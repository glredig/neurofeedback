		<h1>About us</h1>
<p> BrainWorks is directed by Brandi Lozada-Johnston BCN, Neurofeedback Board Certified - BCIA.org,   Psychology, BA & Dance Educator (State of NM Licensed Teacher pre K-12 Performing Arts Teaching and Physical Eduction). </p>

<p>As a Board Certified Neurofeedback Coach with five yearsâ€™ experience providing neurofeedback services to address emotional, learning, performance skills and stress-related concerns, I am confident of my ability to make a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of my clients, 
With an extensive background and education in dance and performing arts, I have seen first-hand how the mind and body can train together to enhance health while increasing confidence and aiding self-realization. This experience compelled me to pursue the burgeoning field of neurofeedback, which has been proven to greatly improve brain function and treat a wide range of issues, including brain dysregulations, sleep disturbances, and learning disorders in addition to serving as an affordable way to optimize cognitive functioning (concentration, flexibility, & memory) and upgrade athletic performance. I offer proven expertise assessing client needs and goals, developing and administering neurofeedback training plans, documenting and analyzing progress, and adjusting neurofeedback protocols to improve training effectiveness. I would be pleased to continue my record of success as your next Neurofeedback Coach.</p>

<p> Brainworks Neurofeedback offersa welcoming and comfortable office setting. Consultations are free. You can call, email or set up an appointment to discuss Neurofeedback treatment for your symptoms and desired goals. </p>
<div id="expectations"> What To Expect: 
	<ol>
