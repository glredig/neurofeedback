<h3> 1.	What is Neurofeedback? </h3>

<blockquote>"In my opinion, if any medication had demonstrated such a wide spectrum of efficacy [as neurofeedback], it would be universally accepted and widely used" 
	<br>
<span> - Frank Duffy (Harvard neurologist) 
 	Clinical EEG and Neuroscience, January 2000. </span> 
 </blockquote>

<p> Neurofeedback is a non-invasive, non-medicated and long term treatment for ADHD, PTSD, sleep, self regulation and more. </p>
 
<p>Links to primary articles showing the effectiveness of Neurofeedback in treating pain, addiction, autism, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, headaches, insomnia, Tourette syndrome and brain damage from strokes or trauma are found in the links tab. </p>
<br><br>
<h3> 2.	How is Neurofeedback done?</h3>
<p>Brainwave activity is measured with an electro-encephalograph (EEG). The EEG equipment is connected to the individual with sensors that are attached on the scalp and ears. The sensors are safe, do not prick the skin and are painless. There is no application of any voltage or current to the brain. It’s entirely non-invasive. Clients are taught to play movies or computerized games using their brainwave activity. Changes in client brainwave activity are fed back to the individual through visual and/or auditory, sensory information by the computer.  </p>

		<h1>About us</h1>
<p> BrainWorks is directed by Brandi Lozada-Johnston BCN, Neurofeedback Board Certified - BCIA.org,   Psychology, BA & Dance Educator (State of NM Licensed Teacher pre K-12 Performing Arts Teaching and Physical Eduction). </p>

<p>As a Board Certified Neurofeedback Coach with five years’ experience providing neurofeedback services to address emotional, learning, performance skills and stress-related concerns, I am confident of my ability to make a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of my clients, 
With an extensive background and education in dance and performing arts, I have seen first-hand how the mind and body can train together to enhance health while increasing confidence and aiding self-realization. This experience compelled me to pursue the burgeoning field of neurofeedback, which has been proven to greatly improve brain function and treat a wide range of issues, including brain dysregulations, sleep disturbances, and learning disorders in addition to serving as an affordable way to optimize cognitive functioning (concentration, flexibility, & memory) and upgrade athletic performance. I offer proven expertise assessing client needs and goals, developing and administering neurofeedback training plans, documenting and analyzing progress, and adjusting neurofeedback protocols to improve training effectiveness. I would be pleased to continue my record of success as your next Neurofeedback Coach.</p>

<p> Brainworks Neurofeedback offersa welcoming and comfortable office setting. Consultations are free. You can call, email or set up an appointment to discuss Neurofeedback treatment for your symptoms and desired goals. </p>
